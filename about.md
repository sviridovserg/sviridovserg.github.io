 <p class="message">
    I am a software developer living in Sydney, Australia who is passionate about developing and designing excellent applications using different set of tools and technologies. I'm passionate about modern front end frameworks and .NET stack, however, I'm also interested in functional programming, DevOps and automation test practices. I have broad experience working in Agile environments and strong believer that great products are made by great people not technologies. I'm striving to learn more about building self-organizing teams and being better leader.
