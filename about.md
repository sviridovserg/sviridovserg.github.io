 <p class="message">
    I am a software developer living in Sydney, Australia who is passionate about developing and designing excellent applications using different set of tools and technologies. I'm vary interested in modern front end frameworks and .NET stack, however, I'm also curious about functional programming, DevOps and automation test practices. I have broad experience working in Agile environments and strong believer that great products are made by great teams not technologies. I'm striving to learn more about building self-organizing teams and being better leader.
